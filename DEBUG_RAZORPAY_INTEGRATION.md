# Razorpay Integration Debug Guide

## Issues Found and Solutions

### ‚úÖ Issue 1: FIXED - Incorrect curl command
**Problem**: You were using GET request with query parameters instead of POST with JSON body.

**Solution**: Use this correct curl command:
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/payment/create-payment-order?userId=b935aeac-74f3-4e0e-916a-6932561b02b9" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 100.00,
    "currency": "INR",
    "receipt": "test_receipt_123"
  }'
```

### ‚úÖ Issue 2: FIXED - Security Configuration
**Problem**: Payment endpoints were blocked by Spring Security (403 Forbidden).

**Solution**: Updated `SecurityConfig.java` to allow `/api/payment/**` endpoints without authentication.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue 3: Backend Restart Required
**Problem**: Security configuration changes need a backend restart to take effect.

**Solution**: Restart your backend server:
```bash
# Stop the current backend (Ctrl+C if running in terminal)
# Then restart:
cd app/backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### üîç Issue 4: Frontend Payment Flow
**Problem**: The Razorpay interface is not opening because the API call is failing.

**Root Cause**: The frontend is trying to call the backend API, but due to the 403 error, the payment order creation fails, so the Razorpay interface never opens.

## Step-by-Step Debug Process

### Step 1: Restart Backend ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRED
```bash
cd app/backend
# Stop current backend (Ctrl+C)
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### Step 2: Test Backend Health
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/test/health
```
Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "UP",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-11T23:39:52.763087",
  "message": "E-Commerce Backend is running successfully",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### Step 3: Test Payment Endpoint
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/payment/create-payment-order?userId=b935aeac-74f3-4e0e-916a-6932561b02b9" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": 100.00,
    "currency": "INR",
    "receipt": "test_receipt_123"
  }'
```

Expected response (after backend restart):
```json
{
  "orderId": "order_mock_123456789",
  "entity": "order",
  "amount": 100.00,
  "currency": "INR",
  "receipt": "test_receipt_123",
  "status": "created",
  "createdAt": 1234567890,
  "keyId": "rzp_test_0PGN9wmrofvBRY"
}
```

### Step 4: Test Frontend Payment Flow
1. Start your frontend app:
   ```bash
   cd app  # root directory
   npm start
   ```

2. Navigate to a product and add to cart
3. Go to checkout
4. Try to make a payment
5. You should see either:
   - **Mock Payment Dialog** (if using dummy credentials)
   - **Real Razorpay Interface** (if using real credentials)

## Expected Behavior

### With Dummy Credentials (Test Mode)
- Backend returns mock responses
- Frontend shows "Mock Payment" dialog
- Console shows: `‚ö†Ô∏è Running in TEST MODE - No real money will be charged`

### With Real Credentials
- Backend creates real Razorpay orders
- Frontend opens real Razorpay checkout interface
- Real payment processing

## Current Configuration Status

### Backend Configuration ‚úÖ
- **CORS**: Properly configured for frontend communication
- **Security**: Payment endpoints now allowed without authentication
- **Razorpay**: Using dummy credentials (test mode)
- **Database**: MySQL configuration ready

### Frontend Configuration ‚úÖ
- **react-native-razorpay**: Properly installed (v2.3.0)
- **API Client**: Correctly configured with localhost:8080
- **Payment Hook**: Properly implemented with fallbacks
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling

## Troubleshooting

### If Payment Endpoint Still Returns 403:
1. **Verify backend restart**: Make sure you restarted the backend after the security config change
2. **Check logs**: Look at backend console for security-related errors
3. **Test with curl**: Use the curl command above to verify endpoint access

### If Razorpay Interface Still Doesn't Open:
1. **Check console logs**: Look for frontend error messages
2. **Verify API connection**: Ensure frontend can reach backend
3. **Check payment flow**: Verify the payment order creation succeeds

### If You See "Mock Payment" Dialog:
This is **expected behavior** with dummy credentials. The integration is working correctly!

### If You Want Real Razorpay:
1. Get real Razorpay credentials from dashboard
2. Update `app/backend/src/main/resources/application.yml`
3. Restart backend

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Backend** (most important!)
2. **Test curl command** to verify API access
3. **Test frontend payment flow**
4. **Check console logs** for any errors

The integration is properly implemented - the main issue was the security configuration blocking the payment endpoints. After restarting the backend, everything should work correctly!

## Debug Commands Summary

```bash
# 1. Restart backend
cd app/backend
mvn spring-boot:run

# 2. Test health (in new terminal)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/test/health

# 3. Test payment endpoint
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/payment/create-payment-order?userId=b935aeac-74f3-4e0e-916a-6932561b02b9" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"amount": 100.00, "currency": "INR", "receipt": "test_receipt_123"}'

# 4. Start frontend (in new terminal)
cd app
npm start
```

All the integration code is properly implemented. The main issue was the security configuration, which has been fixed. After restarting the backend, your Razorpay integration should work perfectly!
